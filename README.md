# Pinball_Intermediate_Game_Dev
james Li

For this project, I wanted to go for a disgusting theme so I chose to replicate the digestive system. I modelled the obstacles based on human organs and related them back to their functions, such as the tunnel function for the intestines and the blood splats for the heart. I gave them jiggly sound effects and a bounce when you hit them to emulate their softness. Through building these features, I learned alot about how 2D physics works in Unity. I also gained a better understanding of to utilize UI to display score, game over, and to restart your game. I think I did good on the theme, I put a lot of effort into 3D modelling the sprites for a 3D look. However, I feel that my programming for this project was not the best. The scripts feel unoptimized but I think that I can fix that over time with more coding practice.

Controls:
F and J to control flippers
Hold Space to Launch ball
